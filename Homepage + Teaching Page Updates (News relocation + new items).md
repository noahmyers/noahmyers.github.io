# Homepage + Teaching Page Updates (News relocation + new items)

## Goal
Move the existing **News** section off the Teaching page and make the Home page the single “home” for news/media mentions. Keep the Home page academic-first and uncluttered.

---

## 1) Teaching page (teaching.html)

### REMOVE
- Remove the entire **News** section block currently on the Teaching page:
  - The "News" heading/title
  - All News items underneath it (including the KSL 5 TV item)

### OPTIONAL REPLACE (pointer line only)
- Add a short pointer near the bottom of the Teaching page (optional):
  - "Media mentions and updates are listed on the Home page under News."

---

## 2) Home page (index.html)

### INSERT LOCATION
- Insert a **News** section near the bottom of the Home page,
  immediately ABOVE the footer (or above the final closing content container).

### INSERT (News block)
## News

- **New Research Sheds Light on the PCAOB’s Enforcement Process**  
  *Forbes* (Sep 8, 2025) — cites my research.

- **Embracing AI in the Classroom**  
  *KSL 5 TV* — I discussed how we are integrating generative AI into accounting coursework at Utah Valley University, including using tools like ChatGPT for spreadsheet automation. I emphasized that AI introduces real risks that require clear guardrails, but that students who learn to use AI as an assistant will be better positioned to focus on higher-judgment work and add value in professional settings.

## 3) Formatting rules (keep it academic, not salesy)
- Keep **News** to **1–3 bullets** on the Home page.
- No cards, no “featured” graphics, no CTAs (“Book me,” “Hire me,” etc.).
- If the News list grows beyond 3–4 items, create **/news.html** and:
  - Show only the 1–2 most recent items on the Home page
  - Add a final link: "More news →" pointing to /news.html
