I help accountants navigate the technologies, analytical mindsets, and ethical challenges shaping the future of the profession. In both classrooms and in professional settings, I guide students and practitioners through:

- **Accounting Information Systems** & internal controls  
- **Data Analytics and Visualization** for auditing and decision support  
- **Applied AI & Automation** (VBA, Alteryx, Power Automate, Python, SQL)  
- **Audit Methodology and Emerging Assurance Tools**

My research examines how regulation, technology, and information access reshape auditing and assurance. I study auditor oversight, information search behaviors, and emerging audit tools—and recently coauthored a case on the internal control failures behind FTX’s collapse.

I design courses that integrate real-world datasets, live demonstrations, and hands-on labs so participants leave with practical, actionable skills. Recent talks have explored how generative AI reshapes audit evidence, workflow automation in accounting, and insights from the collapse of FTX.

Before academia, I audited complex IT environments at **Ernst & Young** and implemented accounting software for mid-market clients at **Squire & Company**—experience I draw on to make each lesson practical, relevant, and engaging.

Students can explore the **Teaching** tab for syllabi, sample assignments, and classroom projects. Colleagues and professionals are welcome to download my **CV** or [contact me](mailto:noah.myers@uvu.edu) to collaborate on guest lectures, professional development sessions, research projects, or curriculum design.
