# Homepage Copy Update (Make Academic-first)

## 1) Hero section headers

### REMOVE (current hero/subtitle)
- "Speaker & Accounting Professor"
- Any hero copy that leads with speaking or helping organizations (e.g., "I help organizations and professionals...")

### REPLACE WITH
Name and Title plus
Technology, audit regulation, and information access in assurance


## 2) Main paragraph directly under hero (single paragraph)

### REMOVE (current paragraph under hero)
Remove the existing homepage lead paragraph that begins with (or substantially resembles):
- "I help organizations and professionals navigate the technologies, analytical mindsets, and ethical challenges shaping the future of the profession..."

### REPLACE WITH (new academic-first paragraph)
I am an Assistant Professor of Accounting at Utah Valley University’s Woodbury School of Business. My work sits at the intersection of auditing, technology, and information access—examining how regulation and changing information environments shape assurance and how investors and other stakeholders respond to audit-related events. I teach accounting information systems and accounting data analytics, with an emphasis on systems thinking, internal controls, and using modern tools to analyze and communicate business information.


## 3) Buttons under the paragraph (keep four)

### REMOVE / ADJUST (current buttons)
- Remove or demote any “Book a Presentation” / “Speaking Topics” buttons if they currently appear first or are visually emphasized above CV/academics.
- Remove any button labels that sound promotional (e.g., "Book Now", "Get in Touch" if it’s the primary CTA).

### REPLACE WITH (four buttons, in this order)
1. CV
2. Research
3. Teaching
4. Speaking

## 4) Corporate speaking paragraph (single paragraph lower on page)

### REMOVE (current speaking section on homepage)
Remove the homepage content block(s) titled or structured like:
- "What I Speak About"
- Any multi-card / multi-bullet topic lists
- Any section that contains multiple speaking topics on the homepage

### REPLACE WITH (new single paragraph speaking blurb)
I also offer occasional talks and workshops for professional audiences (CPE groups, firms, and student organizations) on auditing, technology, and applied AI in accounting. These sessions are research-informed and practical, typically using concrete cases and demonstrations to help audiences understand how emerging tools and information environments affect accounting work and assurance. Details on formats and sample topics are available on the Speaking & Workshops page.
